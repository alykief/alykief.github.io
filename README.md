# Technology & Style
Created with a basis of HTML and JS (MEAN stack) with a load of CSS to capture design style. All headers were hand designed to reflect the personality of the coder.

# Methods
First, created separate HTML pages and all headers with a simplistic set-up. Then went in and added crucial elements included stand-alone pop-up links for external sources (GitHub, LinkedIn, IG, etc.) and direct link pages for the rest. Focused on achieving a PDF download option for recruiters and businesses so they can easily obtain a copy of the resume for their own records. 

# Issues 
Currently focusing on adding in functional versions of all projects in resume along with pop-up modals instead of direct link HTML pages.
